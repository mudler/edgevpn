Besides, it is used as a mechanism of protection: if nodes are not part of the blockchain, they can’t talk to each other.\nThe blockchain is ephemeral and on-memory, optionally can be stored on disk.\nEach node keeps broadcasting it’s state until it is reconciled in the blockchain. If the blockchain would get start from scratch, the hosts would re-announce and try to fill the blockchain with their data.\n Simple (KISS) interface to display network data from the blockchain asymmetric p2p encryption between peers with libp2p randezvous points dynamically generated from OTP keys extra AES symmetric encryption on top. In case randezvous point is compromised blockchain is used as a sealed encrypted store for the routing table connections are created host to host and encrypted asymmetrically  Connection bootstrap Network is bootstrapped with libp2p and is composed of 3 phases:\n  In the first phase, nodes do discover each others via DHT and a randevouz secret which is automatically generated via OTP.\nOnce peers know about each other a gossip network is established, where the nodes exchange a blockchain over an p2p e2e encrypted channel. The blockchain is sealed with a symmetric key which is rotated via OTP that is shared between the nodes.\nAt that point a blockchain and an API is established between the nodes, and optionally start the VPN binding on the tun/tap device.\n","categories":"","description":"EdgeVPN internal architecture\n","excerpt":"EdgeVPN internal architecture\n","ref":"/edgevpn/docs/concepts/architecture/","tags":"","title":"Architecture"},{"body":"A network token represent the network which edgevpn attempts to establish a connection among peers.\nA token is created by encoding in base64 a network configuration.\nGenerating tokens To generate a network token, run in the console:\nedgevpn -b -g This will print out in screen a base64 token which is ready to be shared on nodes that you wish to join on the same network.\nGenerating configuration files EdgeVPN can read both tokens and network configuration files.\nTo generate a configuration file, run in the console:\nedgevpn -g To turn out a config to a token, you must encode in base64:\nTOKEN=$(edgevpn -g | base64 -w0) which is equivalent to run edgevpn -g -b.\nAnatomy of a configuration file A typical configuration file looks like the following:\notp:dht:interval:9000key:LHKNKT6YZYQGGY3JANGXMLJTHRH7SW3Clength:32crypto:interval:9000key:SGIB6NYJMSRJF2AJDGUI2NDB5LBVCPLSlength:32room:ubONSBFkdWbzkSBTglFzOhWvczTBQJORrendezvous:exoHOajMYMSPrHhevAEEjnCHLssFfzfTmdns:VoZfePlTchbSrdmivaqaOyQyEnTMlugimax_message_size:20971520The values can be all tweaked to your needs.\nEdgeVPN uses an otp mechanism to decrypt blockchain messages between the nodes and to discover nodes from DHT, this is in order to prevent bruteforce attacks and avoid bad actors listening on the protocol. See the Architecture section for more information.\n The OTP keys (otp.crypto.key) rotates the cipher key used to encode/decode the blockchain messages. The interval of rotation can be set for both DHT and the Blockchain messages. The length is the cipher key length (AES-256 by default) used by the sealer to decrypt/encrypt messages. The DHT OTP keys (otp.dht.key) rotates the discovery key used during DHT node discovery. A key is generated and used with OTP at defined intervals to scramble potential listeners. The room is a unique ID which all the nodes will subscribe to. It is automatically generated Optionally the OTP mechanism can be disabled by commenting the otp block. In this case the static DHT rendezvous will be rendezvous The mdns discovery doesn’t have any OTP rotation, so a unique identifier must be provided.
